    Multi-dimensional Big Data analysis was performed to characterize and define the optimal configuration of a multi-sensor heading reference system. A complementary sensor system of a compass and gyro systems was analysed by varying their cutoff frequencies and simulation-time parameters with time-domain statistical analysis. Operational limitations for all components are described. The optimal cutoff frequency was selected at 1 $rad/s$ since this is the ""steady state" frequency after which all larger cutoff frequencies do not alter the response even when varying simulation time. A combination of standard deviation and RMS is suggested as the error metric for the sensors.
